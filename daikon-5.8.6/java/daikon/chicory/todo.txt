Chicory todo list sorted in approximate order of importance.

  - Add switch (--enable-globals or --enable-static-variables) to allow
    instrumentation of static fields (Java's name for global variables).
    Possibly have it take an argument indicating which fields to
    include/ignore.

  - Add --exception switch to allow instrumentation of exceptions.
    To handle exceptional exits, Chicory would need to put a catch statement
    around every method body in the subject program, and add a new program
    point for each thrown exception.
This item is in progress as daikon pull request #56.

  - Consider choosing a new file representation that would be both more
    compact and faster to read and write.  For instance, there is no need
    to repeatedly print the names of variables, nor to represent numbers as
    ASCII printed representations.  The major benefit might be smaller
    dtrace files, but another benefit would be less time on file I/O and on
    parsing/unparsing.
