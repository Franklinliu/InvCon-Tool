Utilities for performing clustering on vector data or difference data,

which does cluster analysis to create splitters -- splitting
conditions that enable Daikon to infer more conditional invariants.)

Changes:
 * Remove "denxview" from the default target in the Makefile.
 * Rename getline to my_getline and my_getline_bool, to avoid conflicts
   with stdio.h.
