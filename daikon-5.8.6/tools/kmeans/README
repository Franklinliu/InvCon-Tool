INTRODUCTION
This package contains software for the kmeans clustering algorithm.
The software has been successfully compiled on the Intel/Linux platform.
To compile, just run the Makefile. The executable is 'kmeans'.

CLASSES

The software was mainly designed using an object-oriented approach, and
was implemented in C/C++.

Below is a table summarizing the classes used by the main software.

Class name  Declared in     Implemented in  Description of purpose
----------  -----------     --------------  ----------------------
Point       point.h         point.cpp       Stores a single point and some
                                            extra information about it.
Cluster     cluster.h       cluster.cpp     Stores sufficient statistics
                                            about a cluster. Has functions 
					    to compute distances etc.
KMeans      kmeans.h        kmeans.cpp      An implementation of the
                                            regular K-means algorithm.
